                    <h1>Biography</h1>
                    <p id="biopar1"> my name is kaleab taye, i was born and raised in Addis Ababa Ethiopia in 1992EC, i am the 
                        third and the last child of my family. i have three brothers and no sister.
                        when me and my brothers grew up in my grand parents house with two cousins. growing up for 
                        me has always been fun for me. one of my cousin in our house was in the same
                        age with me and we had a lot to share. we have always done everything together.
                        eventhough i have always wanted to live with my parents living in with my grandparents have 
                        always been fun, memorable, full of love, dramatic and full of ups and downs.
                        despite being the youngest one and growing up with my grandparents giving me 
                        all the advantages of being the spoild child i was raised with manner and descipline, i havent even realized that till i became an adult.

                    <p id="biopar2">
                        one of the best memory of my childhood is the summer time i used to spend with my parents and my brothers. my mother work in a rular area mostly she dont 
                        take a leave in the summer time, so we would all go to her work place and spend our 2 month there.
                        that was the best time of my year, every year! we would spend the holidays together, go to events together and more importantly we would get to know m
                        ore about eachother.

                        in my childhood i haven't always been a fan of education, i barely gave attention to classes and lessons. my turning point to realizing my dreams and
                        goals happened when i was in grade 7. i had a medical condition and i wasnt able to attend my classes for a little while, and when i came back i wante
                        d to make my parents happy and tried my best to score better grade. i actually did well at that semester and stood 4th in my class. most of the people
                        around me were surprised, a week after this result came in, i forgot to get some paper signed by parents and my chemistry teacher was angry about it.
                        
                        he thought i was playing around and frexing by my resulst. eventhough that wasnt true he was really angry and said a lot of things i didd't wanted to
                        hear. i dont think he thought his words would have that big of an effect on me but the one that got me the best was the part he said "is this your big
                        gest achievement in live? , is this the best you can do?" and at that point i started thinking about the big descisions i have to make in my life. he thought he thought
